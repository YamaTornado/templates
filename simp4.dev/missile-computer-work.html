    First, what kind of missiles am I talking about here? This is about combat missiles, which are used to destroy a specific target.
    There are many different combat missiles, from air-to-air to air-to-ground.
    The biggest difference is not in how the missiles are used, but in how they work, some are laser guided, some are radar guided, and some are given an image and compared to what they see.
    The most important element is the computer that controls the rocket, and decides what the next step of the rocket is.
    There are four important functions of the computer:
    <br>
    1. turn on the engine.
    <br>
    2. move controls.
    <br>
    3. Target acquisition.
    <br>
    4. warhead control.</h3>
    
    <h3>
        These four things usually happen at the same time and the rocket must be able to handle all four things, it is important that no errors happen, because error usually means a high loss. A Hell-Fire missile alone costs $250,000 if there is an error in the computer, there would be a lot of damage, and it can also be dangerous for the people who want to use the missile.
        So one of the most important things to do before selling a rocket is to test all systems thoroughly.
    </h3>

    <h3>

        How is this computer activated?
        In addition to the computer, the rocket also contains a battery that supplies power to all systems. This battery also has a control computer that can switch the power flow on or off. From the moment you create the rocket, this power supply is usually released, so that the computer, the control elements and the sensors are supplied with power.

    <h3>

        How is the rocket steered and the target found?
        In a laser-guided missile, a laser, e.g. from a drone, is directed at the target, and the missile flies towards the point of the laser, for this purpose there is a sensor in the head of the missile that can find this laser. When this sensor has found the laser point, the best possible flight path is calculated within milliseconds, if it is an air-to-ground missile, the flight path is usually quite simple straight to the target, but with a ground-to-ground missile, the missile must first fly to a certain altitude to be able to hit the target from above.
        So that the rocket can then fly to the target, it must be controlled, this is usually done with movable fins, which are located on the sides of the rocket, which are then controlled by the computer at the right moment, so that the air flow can be changed, and the rocket takes a different flight path. There are also rockets where the engine can move in the back of the rocket, but this type is mostly used for the big long range rockets.

    </h3>

    <h3>

        Detonate at the right moment.
        So that the target is then also knocked out, the warhead must be ignited, which often happens shortly before the rocket reaches the target, but sometimes also when the rocket is already inside the object. A distinction is made between what the target object is, if an aircraft is to be hit, it is usually detonated shortly beforehand, but in the case of a tank it is also only detonated when the missile touches the tank. As for the warhead, there are many different ones, there are those that shoot blades, there are those with a spherical shell that then shoot spheres, and there are also those where there is simply explosive in the warhead.
        If the computer ignites the explosive charge, it's over and done with the rocket, because in almost all cases it self-destructs.

        The big question, how do I know all this, very simple answer, I myself am the owner of a rocket company, which is also partly represented in the arms industry.
