<h3>It started at the end of mid 2019 a friend of mine and I play minecraft, the friend I played minecraft with was the owner of a minecraft server. 
    At that time I had nothing to do with programming, and had not even thought about it. 
    I always liked to watch how my friend set up the server, at some point he wanted to learn how to program server plugins with Java.
    He had shown me from time to time how he does it. 
    One day I had also just watched a Youtube tutorial about programming, but then I just thought that such a thing would be much too difficult and too complex.
    Then I did not look further into it, but at the end of 2019 I thought I'll just try it, why exactly I came up with the idea I do not know today, but something inside me seemed to say look at a youtube tutorial on how to program a website. So I did, I had then programmed my first website but frankly this looked terrible, almost no css elements and only html.
    Right after that I asked with full enthusiasm my friend who owns the minecraft server if I could not make a website for the server. After some deliberation he agreed and I started programming a terrible looking website for him.
    After I did this I made a long break with programming, sometimes a bit, but not really.
    But in the middle of 2020 I thought to myself, try it again, try to do it better and that's exactly what I did, this time I got more knowledge about programming with javascript, and css, also I taught myself more html knowledge so I could do everything better, and that's what I did. I programmed a website that this time looked good, that worked properly, and that was well thought out.
    I was overjoyed that I made it.
    I had never made this website online, but it was the beginning of something bigger.
    In the middle of 2020 I founded a company called TOR|Space, what the company did exactly I will not go into detail in this text, but I worked very often on this company, 2021 then I thought that I could program a website for the company, which I did, and since then I like to work on small or large programming projects.
    Right now I'm doing this blog, I'm also learning the programming language rust and I'd like to get more involved with trust - safety.
    The friend who led me to this path is currently programming himself as a front-end developer, and has today plans to make their own cell phone cases brand, I'm already very excited about how this will develop.  </h3>
