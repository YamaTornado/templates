<h3>Have you ever wondered how a missile can accurately fly to its target and then destroy it? Probably not, but I have wondered.</h3>

<h3>When I started to go into the armament industry with TOR|Space, I had a big problem: I didn't know anyone who knew exactly how to control missiles.
  So I had to figure it out myself. So I started asking in all the forums if anyone knew how to do it, and I asked other companies if they could help me (of course none of them helped me). 
  Somehow, with the knowledge I had, I managed to figure out the best way to control such a rocket.
<br>
I knew that much:
<br>
Aircraft, drone or ground crew had a laser and aimed it at the object to be destroyed. The missile could see this laser point and flies towards it.
But the big problem was how could this missile see the laser point from a distance of 10 km? 
<br>
I really did not find out, until today I do not know which sensor is used for this. In any case, during my research I also came across other ways of directing a missile to its target, but these ways usually had a hitch. 
<br><br>
IR Sensor: A missile that is guided to its target with infrared works like this: The aircraft/ground station from which the missile is fired tells the missile "this direction is the target" so the missile flies off, emitting infrared rays all the time (not always the missile emits the infrared rays, sometimes an aircraft does too, or the ground station) when these infrared rays hit the flying object they bounce off and fly onto the rocket, this rocket now has a sensor and can calculate how long the distance from it to the object is, and calculates the best possible flight path.
<br>
The problem is that this option only works for flying objects, and only very poorly for ground objects, so if you build a missile that is supposed to hit targets on the ground accurately, it can lead to complications.
</h3>

<h3>

  Radar guided missiles: I am not even sure if radar guided missiles can be used for ground targets. What I am sure of is that a radar system for a missile is too expensive to be useful.

</h3>

<h3>I'm sure there are other options that are being developed, but I needed a solution that would be safe, inexpensive, and easy to implement.
  So another solution is needed.</h3>




  <h3>Then one evening I remembered, airplanes always find their course, and fly in the right direction, and that by gps, so I thought wouldn't it be possible to control the rocket by gps? And yes it is possible, many missiles fly by gps, the best example is the Tomahawk missile.</h3>

<h3>I thought:
<br>

  - The missile must have gps, and permanent reception to a satellite.
<br>
- The missile needs its own altimeter.
<br>
- The missile needs a laser range finder.
<br>
- The missile needs a powerful mini computer that can quickly calculate a route.
